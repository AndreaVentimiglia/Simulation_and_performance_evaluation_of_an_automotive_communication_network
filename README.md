# Simulation and performance evaluation of an automotive communication network
## Description 
Simulation of a Switched Ethernet network for automotive applications in an OMNeT++ environment and performance evaluation in terms of end-to-end delay, Frame Loss Ratio (FLR) and number of queued frames. The performance evaluation was carried out using two different scheduling algorithms: Deadline Monotonic and Earliest Deadline First (EDF).

This project is an extension of the project 'Simulation of a priority traffic management network': [qui](https://github.com/AndreaVentimiglia/Simulation_of_a_priority_traffic_management_network)
